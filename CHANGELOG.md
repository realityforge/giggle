# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.getopt4j` artifact to version `1.3`.
* Remove reflection based integration tests (i.e. `EnumTest`) and related infrastructure (i.e. `AbstractIntegrationTest` and `CompileResults`) as fixture based tests combined with the codegen integration tests have proved to be a more effective mechanisms for testing output.
* Upgrade to version `13.0` of the `graphql-java` library. This resulted in improved code generation as the nodes within the GraphQL schema are now ordered based on appearance in source document rather than based lexicographically. The library also fixed an off-by-one error when reporting parse and validation errors that was exposed in giggle error messages.
* Generate an error if an anonymous operation is defined in a document. Anonymous operations are not supported as the name is used by generators when generating various artifacts.
* Change the name of the the response object from `[OperationName][OperationType]Response` to `[OperationName]Response`. As operation names must be unique within a document, the additional `[OperationType]` name modifier does not increase the uniqueness of the name but does increase the verbosity of the generated API.

### [v0.03](https://github.com/realityforge/giggle/tree/v0.03) (2019-06-13)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/giggle/compare/v0.02...v0.03)

* Refactor the test infrastructure to support multiple generators and to process graphql documents as well as graphql schemas.

#### java-client generator

* Initial implementation of the `java-client` to generate the java native infrastructure for invoking GraphQL operations. The first phase generates:
  - the enum types for every enum in the schema.
  - a compact, minimized graphql document for each GraphQL operation that only contains the operation and any referenced fragments.
  - a java bean representing the response data for each GraphQL operation. The object form is designed to be compatible with JSON-B and Jackson json serialization formats. The response object contains fields for each selection in the operation and static inner classes for all complex sub-selections. The response object is named using the pattern `[OperationName][OperationType]Response`. i.e. The response object for the `event` query is represented by a bean named `EventQueryResponse` while the `updateEvent` mutation is named `UpdateEventMutationResponse`.

### [v0.02](https://github.com/realityforge/giggle/tree/v0.02) (2019-06-11)

#### java-server generator

* Remove final qualifier on `toString()`, `hashCode()` and `equals(Object)` methods in generated input classes. The final qualifier is unnecessary as the class is final.
* Fix bug where the private method `maybeCoerceID(...)` was generated on `*Args` type but was not used. This bug presented when when the type was `[ID!]! @numeric`.
